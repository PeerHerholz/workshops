## Executable pieces (notebooks, scripts, etc.,.)

Use this directory to store any notebooks or other scripts needed for lessons. Recommend creating a directory per lesson. Simply give your lesson a meaningful name: 
`lesson-git`, `lesson-nibabel`, `lesson-container`

## Presentations

Send a pull-request to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/nipy/workshops/tree/gh-pages). We will use a few simple markdown templates for web pages and slides. You can also render your jupyter notebooks as slides to include in the workshop documentation.
